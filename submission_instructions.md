## Description

Daily Deal Decipher is a gamified shopping experience that curates exclusive daily deals based on user interests. Users complete a quick onboarding to select categories (e.g., Tech, Fashion), and the app generates a personalized feed. The centerpiece is the "Daily Mystery" deal, which users tap to "decipher" and reveal a high-value discount.

## Step-by-step testing instructions

1. **Onboarding**: Launch the Mini. You will be greeted by the "Personalize Your Deals" screen. Use the **Search Bar** to find specific categories (e.g., "Electronics") or browse the list. Select at least one category and tap "Start Deciphering". The button will turn green to confirm success before redirecting to the home screen.
2. **Mystery Deal**: On the Home screen, locate the "Daily Mystery" card at the top (marked with a "Locked" or "Tap to Reveal" state). Tap the card to unlock and reveal the top deal of the day.
3. **View Details**: Verify that the revealed card shows the product image, a red discount badge (e.g., -50%), and the product details.
4. **Personalized Feed**: Scroll down to the "For You" section to see a list of other deals matching your selected categories.
5. **Edit Preferences**: Tap the **Preferences icon** (sliders) in the top right corner. This will take you back to the onboarding screen with your selections pre-filled. Modify your categories and tap "Save Preferences". Verify that the button changes to "Preferences Saved!" (green) and automatically redirects you back to the deals feed.
