## Description

Daily Deal Decipher is a gamified shopping experience that curates exclusive daily deals based on user interests. Users complete a quick onboarding to select categories (e.g., Tech, Fashion), and the app generates a personalized feed. The centerpiece is the "Daily Mystery" deal, which users tap to "decipher" and reveal a high-value discount.

## Step-by-step testing instructions

1. **Onboarding**: Launch the Mini. You will be greeted by the "Personalize Your Deals" screen. Use the **Search Bar** to find specific categories (e.g., "Electronics") or browse the list. Select at least one category and tap "Start Deciphering".
2. **Mystery Deal**: On the Home screen, locate the "Daily Mystery" card at the top (marked with a "Locked" or "Tap to Reveal" state). Tap the card to unlock and reveal the top deal of the day.
3. **View Details**: Verify that the revealed card shows the product image, a red discount badge (e.g., -50%), and the product details.
4. **Personalized Feed**: Scroll down to the "For You" section to see a list of other deals matching your selected categories.
5. **Edit Preferences**: Tap the **Preferences icon** (sliders) in the top right corner. This will take you back to the onboarding screen where your current selections are pre-filled. Try adding/removing a category and tap "Save Preferences" to update your feed, or use the "Close" (X) button to return without saving.
